Everything that is installed on the Node Controller lives here.  There
are three basic pieces: 

* the baseOS (a Linux distro) for the ODROID

* the waggle-customized OS that includes all basic management
  features and cloud communication layers

* the in-situ processing components for processing audio, images,
  hyperspectral data, etc.

How to configure your odroid as a node controller: 
1) Type ./configure in the command line and hit enter. 
2)Follow instructions to type in server_ip address.
2)Wait for odroid to reboot.
3)Voila! You have a node controller. No additional actions neccessary.
