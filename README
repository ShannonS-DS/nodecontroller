Everything that is installed on the Node Controller lives here.  There
are three basic pieces: 

* the baseOS (a Linux distro) for the ODROID

* the waggle-customized OS that includes all basic management
  features and cloud communication layers

* the in-situ processing components for processing audio, images,
  hyperspectral data, etc.

How to configure your odroid as a node controller: 
1) Type ./configure in the command line and hit enter. Wait for odroid to reboot.
2) SSH into root@NodeController
3) cd waggle/nodecontroller
4) ./startup.sh
