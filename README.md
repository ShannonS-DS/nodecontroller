## Installation

The nodecontroller is already installed on the Waggle image. If you need the very latest version of the nodecontroller you can do a git pull:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/waggle/nodecontroller/
git pull
```

Alternatively you can do a git clone on any Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/lib/waggle/
cd /usr/lib/waggle/
git clone https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle_image.git
git clone --recursive https://github.com/waggle-sensor/nodecontroller.git
cd nodecontroller
```

Also, if you are not using the Waggle image, you may have to install the dependencies of the nodecontroller. This script uses apt-get commands. For other Linux distributions look into this file to see what needs to be installed.
```bash
scripts/install_dependencies.sh
```

### Installation with Docker (only x86)

A docker image is available for testing and developing purposes. Currently this is x86, thus it will not run on the ODROID which has an ARM architecture. We will provide ARM Docker images hopefully soon.

```bash
docker rm -f nc
docker pull waggle/nodecontroller
docker run -ti --name nc --rm waggle/nodecontroller
cd /usr/lib/waggle/nodecontroller/
```

For developing purposes mounting the git repo from the host can be helpful:
```bash
mkdir -p cd ${HOME}/git/
cd ${HOME}/git/
git clone --recursive git@github.com:waggle-sensor/nodecontroller.git
docker run -ti --name nc --rm -v ${HOME}/git/nodecontroller/:/usr/lib/waggle/nodecontroller  waggle/nodecontroller
```

## Configuration

To tell the node controller where to send the sensor data. Run the configure script with the -s option (--server=... also works) :

```bash
cd /usr/lib/waggle/nodecontroller/
./configure -s <HOSTNAME>
```

This can also be achieved by setting the environment variable WAGGLE_SERVER:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/waggle/nodecontroller/
export WAGGLE_SERVER=<HOSTNAME>
./configure
```

Inside of a Docker container communication with the guest node may require overwriting NCIP. Access to ports 9090 and 9091 is restricted by only exposing them instead of publishing them. 
```bash
echo "0.0.0.0" > /etc/waggle/NCIP
```

### SSL certificates

The nodecontroller needs SSL certificates to be able to talk to the RabbitMQ component of the beehive server. Those files are not installed on the Waggle image.

SSL related files expected by the nodecontroller:
```text
Private key of the node:                   /usr/lib/waggle/SSL/node/key.pem
Public certificate of the node:            /usr/lib/waggle/SSL/node/cert.pem
Public certificate of the RabbitMQ server: /usr/lib/waggle/SSL/waggleca/cacert.pem
```

The certificate files have to be created by the certificate authority on the beehive server. In principle there are two ways for the nodecontroller to get theses files. 

1. Manual: The beehive administrator creates keys for the node and the node user has to copy them onto the node, e.g. using ssh.
2. Automatic: In some circumstances it can be an option to use a certificate server. If the certificate server is running, the nodecontroller software can automatically download the required files. Note that for security reasons this option might be available only in internal networks or with other special restrictions to avoid abuse. 



## Services

At the moment waggle service are started by supervisor, a simple process control system. The configure script should set everything up that the service will be started automatically.

Status of waggle services:
```bash
supervisorctl status
```

The result could look like this:
```text
waggle_communications            RUNNING    pid 7241, uptime 3:30:13
waggle_data_cache                RUNNING    pid 7243, uptime 3:30:13
waggle_plugin_manager            STOPPED    Feb 25 05:27 PM
waggle_wagman                    RUNNING    pid 7242, uptime 3:30:13
```


Stop a service:
```bash
supervisorctl stop waggle_communications
```

Start a service:
```bash
supervisorctl start waggle_communications
```

* NOTE: waggle-communications service needs up to a minute to accept incoming connection from payloads after restart.


## Simple CPU temperature sensor

This script can be used to test sending of sensor data. Note that this script sends data to the data cache. It does not check if data actually arrives at the server.

```bash
cd /usr/lib/waggle/nodecontroller/nc-wag-os/waggled/NC
./node_sensor.py 
```



## Developer Notes

Everything that is installed on the Node Controller lives here.  There
are three basic pieces: 

* the baseOS (a Linux distro) for the ODROID
   (we are curently using a ODROID stock ubuntu image, not in this repo)

* the waggle-customized OS that includes all basic management
  features and cloud communication layers

* the in-situ processing components for processing audio, images,
  hyperspectral data, etc.
